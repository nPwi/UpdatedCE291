# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

*Include a paragraph or two, agreed by all team members, on how well the group has worked together, and how well the project is progressing.*

- The team worked collaboratively together, it was the storming stage at first where we ironed out the difference in opinions and workstyle, and eventually settled on having 1 person to make key decisions while the rest weight in on comments. The project faced some road blocks at the start due to competency level in the programming language, however we have managed to caught up in the later sprints with everyone putting extra hours to learn.

*Discuss the scrum meetings, and what could make them more efficient (if anything).*

- During each scrum, we religiously follow through with Daily Scrums, Scrum Reviews, Scrum Retrospective and Sprint Planning. The Scrum Retrospective is where we continue to "form" the team after the storming stage from everyone's feedback on each another's working style and how we could further collaborate. We have improvised our Daily Scrums to be via online messaging instead of going onto calls or meeting in person as the project scope is relatively smaller.

*Highlight any communication issues that might be affecting the project.*
- The initial challenge we faced was that project transparency and communication was low due to the online scrum meetings. As we go through each sprint, we better manage our expectations to know the limitations of online sessions.

*If standup meetings were used, then include a Jira link, and discuss their effectiveness.*
- Stand-up meetings were used on a daily basis over instant messaging. It has helped us identify challenges very quickly whenever one member faces a roadblock. It also provided transparency of work done across the team and allowed us to avoid duplication or re-works.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion
*Add a discussion of what the burndown charts indicate, and how your team might improve their velocity / estimation ability in future sprints.*

- We all agreed that we are a very young team which lack maturity in the Scrum agile space. We were a little caught up in the beginning with all the chao and was not able to tie down on stable velocity. Only after the 2nd sprint, we started to understand the storypoints and were able to normalize the speed and points.

- We have observed that our guideline vs actual storypoints were having a waterfall at the end of each sprint due to the individual backlog being 1 big item per sprint. We would have been able to have a better insight on the burndown chart if each member took on 3-5 sprint items per sprint and the guideline vs actual would then be able to provide us a better forecast and storytell into improving.

## Product Backlog
*Include here a screenshot of your current product backlog.*

- All backlog have been completed and closed off. We are ready for final product release. We are looking forward to gathering feedbacks from the stakeholders and market to continuously improve our product.

## Other Areas
*If your team has anything else they want to demonstrate, e.g. advanced project management tools, reporting graphs with suitable explanation and interpretation, advanced use of Jira (e.g. issue links, epics, versions), or continuous integration tools, then include a summary here.*
- The team have used GitHub to continuously integrate and deploy during the sprint phrases. We have had some issues getting everyone to work through different branches before committing but were able to align well after the 3rd sprint. 
- We have also used Confluence on JIRA to store critical project information as a wiki page for all members to be updated and collaborate as and when additional details or requirements are flagged out.
