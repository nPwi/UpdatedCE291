# Product Demonstration Report

From our MVP, we have developed the full suite of requirements that the stakeholders wanted. We have also revamp the main menu to give it a very sleek look alongside changing the color theme for the Sudoku with bright yellow and white to give it a starking contrast against the sleek black menu. 

Like how a Magikarp turns into a Gyarados, our raw MVP have now turned into a commercial product ready for release and sales.

## Proud Moments ##

- We are extremely proud about the solver feature which uses a backtrack logic as it solves. It took us awhile with R&D to understand and come up with the logic for multi-complexity Sudoku.

- We were able to revamp the majority of the codes to work within a looping frame that allows us to go back and forth without disruption. Given our first module in the entire course, we were very proud to pull off something so technical while having to commit time to our Full-Time jobs.
