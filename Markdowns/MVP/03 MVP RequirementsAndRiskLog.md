**Story Description & Summary:**
As a player, I would want to have a Sudoku game that I can generate different difficulty levels and have the intelligence solve it on it's own. Upon multiple attempts of solving, I would like to have an option to perform an analysis on the intelligence's ability to solve the levels.

* *Include a screenshots of any relevant attachments.*

*In addition to user stories (which is the main thing we are trying to teach for agile), try to include one or two other requirement modelling techniques, e.g. as listed in the lecture.*

*Try to group the requirements under two sub-headings: functional requirements, and non-functional requirements.*

*When marking this section we will be looking to see your team has understood the correct way to represent User-Stories and one or more other requirement modelling methods, and the requirements listed are giving as much relevant information for the development team as possible.*
