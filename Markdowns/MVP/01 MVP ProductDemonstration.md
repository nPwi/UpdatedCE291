## Proud Moments ##

We are extremely proud about the solver feature which uses a backtrack logic as it solves. It took us awhile with R&D to understand and come up with the logic for multi-complexity Sudoku.

## Incomplete items ##

In this MVP, we are missing of the following which will be implemented in the final product:

1. Increase/Decrease difficulty feature
2. Analysis generation feature
